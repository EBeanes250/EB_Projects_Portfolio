## PFA_Summer_Data

### Overview

This project aims to analyze the development of baseball players based on multiple metrics such as velocity, spin rate, and vertical break. The dataset used contains these metrics for various players over different days.

### Objectives

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations
- Statistical Analysis
- Machine Learning Modeling

### Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### Key Steps

#### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

We performed various data cleaning steps to make the dataset ready for analysis. This includes handling missing values and converting data types.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We performed EDA to understand the dataset better and figure out how to approach the modeling stage. We used various kinds of plots to visualize the data.

#### Visualizations

Visualizations are done using both Matplotlib and Seaborn. They include:

- Bar plots
- Scatter plots
- Pair plots
- Correlation heatmaps

#### Statistical Analysis

- T-tests
- ANOVA tests

#### Machine Learning Modeling

We have applied the following Machine Learning algorithms:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Conclusions

The project helped in understanding which players have improved over time based on the metrics provided. The machine learning models further assisted in classifying the players into 'Improved' and 'Not Improved' categories.

With a bigger dataset I am confident enough to say that running more classification and regression models can be a key to helping coaches know if players are working on there mechanics / craft etc during there time at the PFA training facility.


Finally, the statistical analysis revealed significant differences in performance metrics such as speed, spin, and vertical break between Day 1 and maximum recorded values. 
Specifically:
Speed: Individuals were generally slower on Day 1 compared to their maximum speed.

Spin: The spin rate was notably lower on Day 1 as opposed to peak performance.

Vertical Break: Lower vertical jumps were observed on Day 1 compared to the highest vertical breaks recorded.
Additionally, we observed variations in these metrics across different days, indicating that performance is not consistent.

Recommendations
Based on these findings, we suggest the following:

*Adjust Training Programs:* Incorporate more speed and strength drills to improve Day 1 performance.
*Focus on Technique:* Consider workshops or specialized training to enhance spin and jump techniques.
*Improve Consistency:* Implement exercises aimed at maintaining consistent performance across different days.
*Monitor and Adapt:* Use real-time performance monitoring to make immediate adjustments to training routines.
