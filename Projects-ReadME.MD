## PFA_Summer_Data

### Overview

This project aims to analyze the development of baseball players based on multiple metrics such as velocity, spin rate, and vertical break. The dataset used contains these metrics for various players over different days.

### Objectives

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations
- Statistical Analysis
- Machine Learning Modeling

### Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### Key Steps

#### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

We performed various data cleaning steps to make the dataset ready for analysis. This includes handling missing values and converting data types.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We performed EDA to understand the dataset better and figure out how to approach the modeling stage. We used various kinds of plots to visualize the data.

#### Visualizations

Visualizations are done using both Matplotlib and Seaborn. They include:

- Bar plots
- Scatter plots
- Pair plots
- Correlation heatmaps

#### Statistical Analysis

- T-tests
- ANOVA tests

#### Machine Learning Modeling

We have applied the following Machine Learning algorithms:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Conclusions

The project helped in understanding which players have improved over time based on the metrics provided. The machine learning models further assisted in classifying the players into 'Improved' and 'Not Improved' categories.

Finally, with a bigger dataset I am confident enough to say that running more classification and regression models can be a key to helping coaches know if players are working on there mechanics, craft etc during there time at the PFA training facility.
