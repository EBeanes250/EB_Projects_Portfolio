**Project 1 Baseball Player Development Analysis**
1. PFA_Summer_Data.ipynb

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the development of baseball players based on multiple metrics such as velocity, spin rate, and vertical break. The dataset used contains these metrics for various players over different days.

## Objectives
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations
- Statistical Analysis
- Machine Learning Modeling

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
We performed various data cleaning steps to make the dataset ready for analysis. This includes handling missing values and converting data types.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We performed EDA to understand the dataset better and figure out how to approach the modeling stage. We used various kinds of plots to visualize the data.

## Visualizations
Visualizations are done using both Matplotlib and Seaborn. They include:
- Bar plots
- Scatter plots
- Pair plots
- Correlation heatmaps

## Statistical Analysis
- T-tests
- ANOVA tests

## Machine Learning Modeling
We have applied the following Machine Learning algorithms:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees

## Conclusions
The project helped in understanding which players have improved over the time based on the metrics provided. The machine learning models further assisted in classifying the players into 'Improved' and 'Not Improved' categories.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells in the notebook.
